Easy way to disables all wordpress, themes, plugins, core updates & notifications in wordpress.

== Description ==

Automatic background updates were introduced in WordPress 3.7 in an effort to promote better security, and to streamline the update experience overall.

By default, only minor releases – such as for maintenance and security purposes – and translation file updates are enabled on most sites. In special cases, plugins and themes may be updated.

<strong>In WordPress, there are four types of automatic background updates:</strong>

1. Core updates
2. Plugin updates
3. Theme updates
4. Translation file updates


<strong>Core Updates</strong>

1. Core development updates, known as the "bleeding edge"
2. Minor core updates, such as maintenance and security releases
3. Major core release updates

By default, every site has automatic updates enabled for minor core releases and translation files. Sites already running a development version also have automatic updates to further development versions enabled by default.

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the folder disable-all-wordpress-updates-notifications/ to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
